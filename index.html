					<p>
I’ve been making games since I was 15. I used Unity game design to learn programming and make video games, but I have since supplemented my knowledge with textbooks and school classes. Now as an experienced designer, creating interactive experiences serves as a creative outlet. As a Third Culture Kid, I have been around the world, accumulating experiences. I have also spread my network across the world: I serve as the activities director for the International School of Beijing Shunyi. I currently live in Singapore, where I continue to make video games for school and online competitions.

					<h2>
						My Experiences
					</h2>
					
					<p>
                        Since the beginning of my game development journey, I have worked tirelessly to improve my understanding of design and production. By 16, I had an understanding of game development, but there's only so much that one can learn alone. After working in the Game Development Club at the International School of Beijing I improved both as a leader and as a collaborator. I learned how to communicate ideas and work together in order to produce a higher quality game. By the end of my sophomore year I succeeded in placing second in a game jam. After moving to Singapore, I took the Unity Certification Exam and passed handily. I continue support my club in Beijing and build my portfolio.

						My Work Process
					</h2>
					
					
					
					<!-- text -->
					<p>
Everything is born from a single idea. They can range from mundane to fantastical, but they should all be centered around actions that the player can do in the game. My first step is to draw out a system. What does the player first see when they start the game? How does the game’s interest change over time? Then comes prototyping and experimentation. Continuing to iterate designs and scaffold upon previous builds to create something even more interesting is key to creating a quality game. After that comes polishing and adding additional features to emphasize the most engaging mechanics.
